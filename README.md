## Reasoning Behind the Project

To integrate helpful technology into the insurance space inspired this focused internal tool. The app simulates a typical use case in a broker environment:
- Onboarding new clients
- Tracking policies
- Monitoring renewals
- Viewing operational metrics

My goal was to keep the app lean, extendable, and business-aligned â€” with clear growth paths if adopted more widely.
